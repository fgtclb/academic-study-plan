:navigation-title: Configuration

..  _configuration:

=============
Configuration
=============

This extension ships its frontend TypoScript and its backend page TSconfig in
two forms: as TYPO3 **site sets**, and as classic **static templates** plus
**page TSconfig files** that are selected on a page. Both forms read the very
same files, so they configure an installation identically.

Pick one of them per site and stay with it — see
:ref:`Do not combine both <one-mechanism-per-site>` for what happens otherwise.

..  _configuration-components:

What the sets contain
=====================

The extension ships one content element, so it ships one component set and one
aggregate set that depends on it.

..  list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    *   -   Set
        -   Delivers
    *   -   `fgtclb/academic-study-plan-content-element`
        -   The :guilabel:`Academic Study Plan` content element: its TypoScript
            (:typoscript:`tt_content.academic_study_plan`, the Fluid root paths
            and the data processor that assigns the semesters and modules to the
            template) and the page TSconfig that makes the content element
            selectable in the backend.
    *   -   `fgtclb/academic-study-plan`
        -   Everything above. This is the set to use unless you deliberately
            want a subset.
    *   -   `fgtclb/academic-study-plan-default`
        -   The name this extension published before the sets were cut per
            component. It delivers exactly what `fgtclb/academic-study-plan`
            delivers, and is kept so that existing site configurations keep
            working.

The component set depends on `fgtclb/academic-base-ctype-group`, the set of
:guilabel:`EXT:academic_base` that labels the content element group all academic
extensions sort their elements into.

..  _configuration-hidden-by-default:

The content element is hidden by default
========================================

:guilabel:`EXT:academic_study_plan` hides its content element for the whole
installation and brings it back per component. Whichever of the two mechanisms
below you use, it is what makes :guilabel:`Academic Study Plan` selectable in the
backend again — without one of them the content element is not offered, and
existing records keep rendering.

This is not new in version 2.4: this extension always hid its content element.
What changed is the file that brings it back and the name it is registered
under — see
:ref:`Breaking: Site sets and static templates have been restructured
<breaking-site-sets-and-static-templates-restructured>`.

..  _site-set:

Include the site set
====================

Add the set to the :file:`config.yaml` of the site that should offer the content
element:

..  code-block:: diff
    :caption: config/sites/my-site/config.yaml (diff)

     base: 'https://example.com/'
     rootPageId: 1
    +dependencies:
    +  - fgtclb/academic-study-plan

<https://docs.typo3.org/permalink/t3coreapi:site-sets-usage>`__.

..  _static-templates:

Include static templates
========================

For an installation that still configures its frontend through
:sql:`sys_template` records, the same files are registered as static templates
and as selectable page TSconfig files.

..  tip::

    On TYPO3 v13 and v14 we recommend the site set — and if you use it, do not
    press the backend button :guilabel:`Create a root TypoScript record` on that
    site. The :sql:`sys_template` record it creates carries the flag
    :guilabel:`Clear` for constants and setup, and that flag discards everything
    the site sets contributed. An installation that is already in that state
    gets its configuration back by selecting the static templates below in that
    very record.

..  _static-typoscript:

Include static TypoScript
-------------------------

Edit the :sql:`sys_template` record of the site root and add the entry to
:guilabel:`Include static (from extensions)`:

..  list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    *   -   Entry
        -   Delivers
    *   -   :guilabel:`Academic Study Plan: Content element (academic_study_plan)`
        -   The TypoScript of the :guilabel:`Academic Study Plan` content
            element.
    *   -   :guilabel:`Academic Study Plan: All components (academic_study_plan)`
        -   Every component this extension ships, in one entry.

..  _static-pagetsconfig:

Include static page TSconfig
----------------------------

Edit the page record of the site root, tab :guilabel:`Resources`, field
:guilabel:`Page TSconfig`, and add the entry:

..  list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    *   -   Entry
        -   Delivers
    *   -   :guilabel:`Academic Study Plan: Content element (academic_study_plan)`
        -   Makes the :guilabel:`Academic Study Plan` content element selectable,
            and configures its entry in the new content element wizard.
    *   -   :guilabel:`Academic Study Plan: All components (academic_study_plan)`
        -   Every component this extension ships, in one entry.

The setting is inherited by every page below the one it is set on.

..  _one-mechanism-per-site:

Do not combine both
===================

A site that uses the site set **and** the static template reads the shipped
files twice. The site set is applied before the :sql:`sys_template` record, so
the second read happens after the site settings and after
:file:`config/sites/<site>/constants.typoscript` — and it resets every constant
the extension ships a default for back to that default. For this extension those
are the three Fluid root paths of the content element.

Nothing else is damaged: the :guilabel:`Constants` and :guilabel:`Setup` fields
of the :sql:`sys_template` record, the page TSconfig of a page and the page
TSconfig files selected on a page are all applied afterwards and still win. Use
one mechanism per site and the question does not arise.
