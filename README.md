Install with your flavour:

* [TER](https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/academic_study_plan/)
* Extension Manager
* composer

We prefer composer installation:

```bash
composer require \
  'fgtclb/academic-study-plan':'^2'
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `3.x.x` is still in development and not all academics extension are fully tested in v13,
> but can be installed in composer instances to use, test them. Testing and reporting are welcome.

**Testing 3.x.x extension version in study plan (composer mode)**

It is already possible to use and test the `2.x` version in composer based instances,
which is encouraged and feedback of issues not detected by us (or pull-requests).

Your project should configure `minimum-stabilty: dev` and `prefer-stable` to allow
requiring each extension but still use stable versions over development versions:

```shell
composer config minimum-stability "dev" \
&& composer config "prefer-stable" true
```

and installed with:

```shell
composer require \
  'fgtclb/academic-study-plan':'3.*.*@dev'
```
